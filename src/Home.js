          I grew up in southern California
          far away from any real food production. Where my food came from or
          what happens to it along the way was the farthest thing from my mind
          growing up. It wasn't until I was in college before I gave it any

          girlfriend (now wife) and I started our own garden in the backyard. It started small, and grew, and grew.
